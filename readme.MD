# EPIC DISCORD LIBRARY WRITTEN IN C
C is a superior programming language so y is there no library for interfacing with the discord api with it? Mabye cause no sane C programmer would use shitty discord anyways. But im creating this for my own maliscious deeds so yeah. Fuck C++, its a shitty language. Python too slow. JS is fucking cancer. Anything else bleh.


This library is goign to be written as clean as possible wit the best documentation out there i can guarentee you that so get read and buckle your fuckle.
